        <div className="subheading">Key Components of Venture Economics</div> {<br></br>}

            <li>
                <div className="title">Stages of Startup Funding</div> {<br></br>}
                <div className="sub">Startup funding is typically divided into several stages, each with distinct characteristics and investor expectations:</div>{<br></br>}

                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> Pre-seed & Seed Stage – </strong> Initial funding to develop a prototype or validate a business idea, often sourced from angel investors, friends, family, or accelerators.</li>

                    <li> <strong>Series A & B –</strong> Growth-stage funding to scale operations, expand market reach, and refine business models. At this stage, venture capital (VC) firms play a dominant role.</li>

                   <li><strong> Series C and Beyond –</strong> Late-stage funding focused on scaling globally, acquiring competitors, or preparing for an initial public offering (IPO).</li>

                   <li><strong>Exit Strategies –</strong> Startups may achieve liquidity through an IPO, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), or secondary sales.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <div className="title">Startup Valuation and Investment Metrics</div> {<br></br>}
                <div className="sub">Investors assess a startup's potential using key valuation metrics, including : </div> {<br></br>}

                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> Revenue and Growth Rate – </strong> How fast the company is scaling and generating revenue.</li>

                    <li> <strong>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs. Lifetime Value (LTV) –</strong> The balance between how much it costs to acquire a customer versus their long-term value.</li>

                   <li><strong> Burn Rate and Runway –</strong> How quickly a startup is spending cash and how long before it needs additional funding. </li>

                   <li><strong>Market Opportunity and Competitive Edge –</strong> The total addressable market (TAM) and how the startup differentiates itself.</li>

                </ul>

                <div className="title">Risk and Returns in Venture Capital</div> {<br></br>}
                <div className="sub">Venture investing is high-risk but can yield significant returns.
